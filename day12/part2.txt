After 91 iterations, a pattern appears where the set of plants shifts right
one pot for each subsequent iteration. This causes the sum of the numbers of
all pots containing plants to increase by 72 on each iteration, so we can 
define a formula for the sum S after N iterations as:

    S(N) = 8574 + 72 * (N - 91)

and calculate

    S(50000000000) = 3600000002022

which is the sum after 50 billion iterations.
